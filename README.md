# PolytonicGreek
Autohotkey version (for Windows use) of the Polytonic Greek Typinator sets created by Bill Thayer (bit.ly/GkTysetsWPT ).

Due to GitHub's file size limitations (25 MB), I had to split the code into two separate scripts (though there's no reason why the user can't just download both files, copy-paste the code from one file to the bottom of the other, and save them as a single consolidated script after downloading): Part 1 contains almost the whole Ἑλληνική 1 typeset; Part 2 contains the remaining entries from the Ἑλληνική 1 typeset plus the remaining seven typesets (Capitalized, Optional 2, Optional 3 shortcuts, Optional 456789, Corrections, προὔ, and ῤῥ).
